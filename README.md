## üêæ About PetSwipe

PetSwipe is a full-stack application that allows users to swipe through pets available for adoption. The app is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a focus on providing a seamless experience for both users and shelter staff.

The app is built using modern technologies, including **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. It leverages the power of **AWS** for storage and deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability.

The app is also designed to be modular and easy to extend, with a focus on clean code and best practices. It includes features such as user authentication, a swipe interface, personalized pet decks, and admin tools for managing pets and users.

And most importantly, it is built with the goal of helping shelter animals find their forever homes. By providing a fun and engaging way for users to browse pets, PetSwipe aims to increase adoption rates and raise awareness about the importance of pet adoption. üêæ

I hope you enjoy using PetSwipe as much as I enjoyed building it! üê±

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ‚â• v18
- **npm** ‚â• v8 or **Yarn**
- **PostgreSQL** (AWS RDS recommended)
- **AWS CLI** & IAM credentials for S3, RDS
- **Docker** (optional, for local Postgres container)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Due to `shadcn/ui` peerDeps, install frontend dependencies with:
>
> ```bash
> npm install --legacy-peer-deps
> # or
> yarn install --ignore-engines
> ```

---

### üõ† Backend Setup

1. **Clone & Install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/PetSwipe-Match-App.git
   cd PetSwipe-Match-App/backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment**
   Copy and configure:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   - `DATABASE_URL`: your AWS RDS Postgres connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`
   - AWS: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - More in `.env.example`. Be sure that you have all required environment variables set up before running the app!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment

The app is designed to be easily deployable to AWS using services like:

- **RDS**: PostgreSQL instance for data
- **S3**: Bucket for pet photo storage
- **Elastic Beanstalk** or **ECS** for backend
- **ECR**: Container registry for Docker images
- **GHCR**: Backup container registry for Docker images
- **CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Vercel** for frontend

**Tip**: Use IAM roles for EC2/ECS to grant S3 & RDS access securely!

### Our Stack

Currently, our stack is fully deployed on AWS using the following services:

1. **AWS RDS**: Manages our PostgreSQL database.
2. **AWS S3**: Stores pet photos and user avatars.
   - Backup service: **Supabase Storage**.
3. **AWS ECS**: Hosts our backend API using Docker containers.
   - Backup service: **Vercel** (currently, due to AWS pricing issues, we have switched to Vercel for hosting the backend).
4. **AWS ECR**: Container registry for our Docker images.
5. **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions for accessing AWS resources.
   - Backup service: **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
6. **AWS CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring.
7. **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD to build and deploy our Docker images to ECR.
8. **Vercel**: Hosts our frontend application.
9. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for managing AWS resources.

---

## üõ† Scripts & Utilities

The app also comes with several scripts and utilities to help with development and deployment:

- **Seed Pets**: `npm run seed:pets`
- **Assign Pets**: `npm run assign:user`
- **TypeORM CLI**: `npm run typeorm <command>`
- **Swagger**: Auto-generated OpenAPI spec

Additionally, a `Makefile` is included for common tasks:

```bash

### Docker

To start the entire app with Docker, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will pull the images from ECR and start the backend and database containers locally on your machine.

Additionally, there are also Shell scripts that help you run Docker commands easily:

1. `pull_and_run.sh`: Pulls the latest Docker image from ECR and runs it.
2. `upload_to_ghcr.sh`: Builds the Docker image and uploads it to GitHub Container Registry (remember to set up your GitHub PAT and username in the script/export them in your shell).

## üß™ Command Line Interface

The app also includes a CLI for managing pets and users. You can run the CLI commands from the root directory:

```bash
petswipe <command> [options]
```

### Available Commands

- `petswipe dev`: Start backend & frontend in development mode.
- `petswipe build`: Build both backend & frontend applications.
- `petswipe docker:build`: Build & push Docker images to GitHub Container Registry.
- `petswipe up`: Pull Docker images and start the stack.
- `petswipe down`: Stop the Docker Compose stack.
- `petswipe clean`: Remove build artifacts.
- `petswipe lint`: Run linters in both projects.
- `petswipe test`: Run tests in both projects.

This CLI is designed to make it easier to manage the application and perform common tasks without having to navigate through multiple directories or run multiple commands.
